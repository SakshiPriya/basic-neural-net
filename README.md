This repository consist various versions of a 3 layer simple neural net.
First one is made using libraries like numpy and matplotlib. Here I have tried to focus on how to train a neural net using basic concepts like backpropagation and batch_normalization.
Second one depict same concept but using torch instead of numpy.
Third and last one makes use of autograd package of pytorch and thus helps us to backpropagate easily
